## Description
This RSC includes the contribution guides that are common across Rosen repositories.

## Tools

### Node
The Node version varies between Rosen repositories, but most include a `.nvmrc` file that specifies the minimum supported Node version. You can install it manually or use `nvm install` if you have [`nvm`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) installed.  
Note that there may be exceptions where this doesn't work. For instance, some monorepo packages might use a different Node version than the one specified in `.nvmrc`.

### NPM
NPM is used as the package manager for all projects. While you can use alternatives like `yarn` or `pnpm`, we do not guarantee they will work, nor do we plan to support them (e.g., we won't add lock files for other package managers).

## Code Conventions
Many style conventions are enforced by a combination of ESLint and Prettier. These tools run automatically during the commit phase via a git hook and are rechecked in the CI pipeline.  
Additional conventions, not yet enforced at the time of writing, include:

### JSDoc
Write JSDoc for all functions and methods in classes unless you have a good reason not to (e.g., NextJS route or page components). At minimum, include a general description of the functionality.

### Arrow Functions
Use arrow functions whenever possible unless a specific reason prevents it (e.g., `this`-aware functions or generators). Parentheses and other styling rules are enforced by ESLint and Prettier.

## Miscellaneous

### Logging
A comprehensive RCS for logging will be provided in the future. For now, include meaningful logs that allow anyone to understand what's happening in the service. Avoid logging sensitive data (e.g., private keys).

### Changesets
We use [`changesets`](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) for versioning and changelogs. Refer to their documentation for usage instructions. Each pull request should include relevant changeset files to update the changelog appropriately. Ensure changeset messages are meaningful as part of the changelog.
Please note that you shouldn't bump package versions in you pull requests, as it is part of the changeset versioning prcoess.

### Kodegen
We use our tool, [`kodegen`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/kodegen), for creating packages and services in our backend monorepos. Use this tool when adding new packages or services.

### Testing
Please refer to [RCS-001](./rcs-001.md) for more info on how to write unit tests.
