## Description
This RCS defines a standard for implementing unit-tests for TypeScript and ErgoScript projects.

## Packages
Tests should be implemented using `vitest`. As `vitest` is an all-in test suite, there is no need
for other packages. To install using `npm`:

```shell
npm install --save-dev vitest
```

## Structure
Tests files are under `tests` directory with same path as the class of under test and additional
`.spec` in test file name. So project directory is something like this:

```
my-app/
├─ lib/
│  ├─ dir1/
│  │  ├─ Class1.ts
│  │  ├─ types.ts
|  |  ├─ ergo_script1.es 
│  ├─ dir2/
│  │  ├─ Class2.ts
│  │  ├─ types.ts
|  |  ├─ ergo_script2.es 
│  ├─ index.ts
├─ tests/
│  ├─ dir1/
│  │  ├─ Class1.spec.ts
|  |  ├─ ergo_script1.spec.ts 
│  ├─ dir2/
│  │  ├─ Class2.spec.ts
|  |  ├─ ergo_script2.spec.ts 
│  ├─ index.ts
├─ package.json
```

Sometimes, test data is large and common between multiple tests. Also, some functions are common
in tests and used to generate test data. Therefore, there is need for another files. Plain test 
data are written in `testData` file. Generating and overall functions are in `testUtils` files
which is in root directory. In nested directories, there may be multiple `testUtils`, which should
be named related to the case.

Some classes cannot be tested directly. An implemented function of an abstract class is an example.
Also for testing a class, there may be a need to implement more functions to access protected values.
In these cases, a test class should be implemented with `Test` prefix.

Some classes depend on other classes and dependencies should get mocked during tests. As a class may
be needed in multiple classes, an independent file containing mocking functions will be created. The
file is located in the same path as test file, under `mocked` directory with `.mock` suffix.

As a result, tests directory can be something like this:

```
tests/
├─ guard/
│  ├─ agreement/
│  │  ├─ mocked/
│  │  │  ├─ TxAgreement.mock.ts
│  │  ├─ agreementTestData.ts
│  │  ├─ TestTxAgreement.ts
│  │  ├─ TxAgreement.spec.ts
│  ├─ event/
│  │  ├─ mocked/
│  │  │  ├─ EventProcessor.mock.ts
│  │  │  ├─ EventVerifier.mock.ts
│  │  ├─ EventProcessor.spec.ts
│  │  ├─ eventTestData.ts
│  │  ├─ EventVerifier.spec.ts
│  ├─ guardTestUtils.ts
├─ testUtils.ts
```

In each TypeScript file, we only test one file. For every class, function or ErgoScript in file, test file contains one root `describe` with class name and for TypeScript modules one `describe` in it for each inner function under test, and for ErgoScript one `describe` in it for each functionality.
Each of these, has multiple `it` which implements the test. Second argument of `describe`, which
is function, is always sync. On the Other hand, second argument of `it` is async, if and only if
the test scenario is async. So test file is something like this:

```typescript
describe(`Class1`, () => {
  describe(`function1`, () => {

    /**
     * ...
     */
    it(`...`, () => {
      
    })

    /**
     * ...
     */
    it(`...`, () => {

    })
  })
  
  describe(`asyncFunction2`, () => {

    /**
     * ...
     */
    it(`...`, async () => {

    })
  })
})
```

In case of multiple exports, it's something like this:

```typescript
describe(`Class2`, () => {
  describe(`classFunction1`, () => {

    /**
     * ...
     */
    it(`...`, () => {

    })
  })

  describe(`classFunction2`, () => {

    /**
     * ...
     */
    it(`...`, async () => {

    })
  })
})
  
describe(`exportedFunction`, () => {

  /**
   * ...
   */
  it(`...`, async () => {

  })
})
```

## Test Document
All tests should have document. Each document includes four sections:

- Target: Specifies class and function under test with summary of test environment, which is 
same as the string in `it`.
- Dependencies: Specifies other classes and functions that should get mocked for this. Also
specifies classes and functions that this test depends on it, even though they are not mocked
such as database records.
- Scenario: Explains scenario of the test. Every step should be specified. It's better that
these steps be placed in test implementation as comments (if scenario is obvious and short,
skipping comments is allowed).
- Expected Output: Specifies expectation of the test as short as possible.

```typescript
/**
 * @target TxAgreement.processTransactionRequest should reject the request when
 * event already has transaction
 * @dependencies
 * - EventVerifier
 * - GuardTurn
 * - database records
 * @scenario
 * - mock two transactions
 * - mock an event
 * - insert event with one of the transactions into database
 * - mock event to get confirmed
 * - mock guard turn
 * - run test
 * - check returned value
 * - check if any requests got sent
 * @expected
 * - it should reject the request
 * - no agreement response should got sent
 */
it(`should reject the request when event already has transaction`, () => {
  // mock two transactions
  ...
  
  // mock an event
  ...
  
  // insert event with one of the transactions into database
  ...
  
  // mock event to get confirmed
  ...
  
  // mock guard turn
  ...
  
  // run test
  ...
  
  // check returned value
  ...
  
  // check if any requests got sent
  ...
  
})
```

In this example, since event and transactions are received from database, `dbAction` is a
dependency (it means some data should be inserted into database). Also, `EventVerifier` should
get mocked to verify mocked event. `GuardTurn` is same as `EventVerifier` case. As for the test
to pass, two things should get checked. Return value should be `false`, which means transaction
got rejected and no response should have sent either.

```typescript
/**
 * @target ChainUtils.isEqualAssetBalance should return true when assets are
 * equal
 * @dependencies
 * @scenario
 * - mock an AssetBalance
 * - run test
 * - check returned value
 * @expected
 * - it should return true
 */
it('should return true when assets are equal', () => {
  const a: AssetBalance = {
    nativeToken: 100n,
    tokens: [
      {
        id: 'id1',
        value: 10n,
      },
      {
        id: 'id2',
        value: 20n,
      },
    ],
  };
  const b = structuredClone(a);

  const result = ChainUtils.isEqualAssetBalance(a, b);

  expect(result).toEqual(true);
});
```

An example of short and obvious tests. Although it's better to have test steps as comments,
since the test scenario is obvious and short, comments can be skipped.

Note that the only reason Target section is written in two lines is to prevent more than 80
characters per line. And please, **comply indentations**!

## Implementation
This section includes technical parts about test with some examples.

### Test Data
Test data should be plain as much as possible. That's it, define some json or strings to represent
data in `testData` files which explained in [structure](#structure) section. It's the best to
avoid using other test data files, and in any necessary cases, use upper test file to generate or
access the data. For example, if an `Event` data is needed for `Agreement` test, it should get
accessed using `guardTestUtils`.

Every test data have some property and since some of them cannot be specified enough in the variable
name, a doc string should exist for every data, explaining its properties.

```typescript
/**
 * a mocked data that represents 10 block headers
 */
export const mockedBlockHeaderJson: ErgoBlockHeader[] = ...
```

For the sake of readability, if the data is large enough, it's better to get categorized based on
some property. For example, Ergo test data can be categorized into `Transactions` and `Boxes`, each
in `transactionsTestData` and `boxesTestData` classes.

Some test data contain complicated and large useless data. Although it's suggested to mock those
data too, there is a syntax to skip mocking those data, which is converting to `unknown` type and
reconvert to data type. Mocking full data helps further development and scalability, at the same time
is expensive and exhausting.

- `Utxo` data type in `types.ts`:
```typescript
interface Utxo {
  payment_addr: PaymentAddr;
  stake_addr?: string | null;
  tx_hash: string;
  tx_index: number;
  value: string;
  asset_list: Array<Asset>;
}

```

- Mocking data partially (no `payment_addr` and `stake_addr` provided): 

```typescript
/**
 * a mocked box with no assets
 */
export const mockedUtxo: Utxo = {
  tx_hash: '916f0027a575074ce72a331777c3478d6513f786a591bd892da1a577bf2335f9',
  tx_index: 1,
  value: '1000000',
  asset_list: [],
} as unknown as Utxo;
```

### Mocking
In testing, there will be many cases where function under test depends on some other classes and
functions. Based on the function and the purpose of the test, the behavior of the dependencies
should get mocked. There are two ways to do this. If the test depends on another function or variable which
is not under any classes and is exported directly, `vi.mock` should be used (Refer to 
[guard-service assets API test](https://github.com/rosen-bridge/guard-service/blob/8364525b704ad1d463fc5e85a0a494310fef338a/tests/api/assets.spec.ts#L12) for example). If the function is under
some classes, `vi.spyOn` should be used.

> Please refer to [vitest cheat-sheet](https://vitest.dev/guide/mocking.html#cheat-sheet) for more complex mocking scenarios.

In this standard, functions are declared to mock functions. These functions are defined in `Mocked`
files explained in [structure](#structure) section. Generally, mocked file is something like this:

- Class `UnderTest` in file `UnderTest.ts`:

```typescript
class UnderTest {
  classSyncFunction = () => {}
  
  classAsyncFunction = async (x: number, y: number) => {}

  static classStaticFunction = () => {}
}

export { mockGetIt, mockGetNumber, mockGetString, resetMocks }
```

- File `UnderTest.mock.ts`:

```typescript
import { when } from "vitest-when";

const spyOn = vi.spyOn

const mockClassSyncFunction = (object: ClassA, ret: string) => {
  spyOn(object, 'classSyncFunction').mockReturnValue(ret)
}

const mockClassAsyncFunction = (object: ClassA, x: number, y: number, ret: number) => {
  when(spyOn(object, 'classAsyncFunction')).calledWith(x, y).mockResolveValue(ret)
}

const mockClassStaticFunction = (ret: string) => {
  spyOn(ClassA, 'classStaticFunction').mockReturnValue(ret)
}

const resetMocks = () => {
  vi.resetAllMocks()
}

export { mockGetIt, mockGetNumber, mockGetString, resetMocks }
```

Note that mock functions also need doc strings which is not provided in above code!

### Result Checking
Result checking is done using `expect`. Whenever equality of a value is under check, `.toEqual`
should be used (use `toBe` only when object references should be checked). Also, use `toContain`
and `toContainEqual` when containing value is under check (`toContain` uses strict equality where
`toContainEqual` uses deep equality). To check if some functions is called, `toHaveBeenCalled` 
should be used. There are multiple kind of this function, which take number of call and/or call
arguments as input. Use `toHaveBeenCalledWith` if the expected call argument is known.

```typescript
expect(classB.function1(5, 10)).toEqual(31)
expect(classB.function2).toHaveBeenCalledWith(5, 5)
```

In case exception throw is expected, since `vitest` built-in support for exception throw pass `undefined`
as function arguments, the following style should be used:

```typescript
expect(() => {classB.function(5, 10)}).toThrow(Error)
await expect(async () => {await classB.asyncFunction(5)}).rejects.toThrow(Error)
// expect error by message
expect(() => {classB.function(5, 10)}).toThrow(`exception message`)
```

Try to avoid expecting errors by their message. It's better to expect errors by their type and only if
there are multiple errors with same type and different messages, expect them by their message.

### After and Before Each
Some actions are common between multiple tests of a single function such as mocking base functions
and clearing database tables. These actions should be used in `beforeEach` or `afterEach` function
which is called in test category `describe`.

```typescript
describe(`...`, () => {

  beforeEach( async () => {
    await clearDatabaseTables()
  })

  /**
   * 
   */
  it(`test with x > 5`, () => {
    ...
  })
})
```

### Global setup
If there are some "setup work" which needs to be run before all the tests, they should be put in a vitest
setup file instead of including it in all of test files. An example of such setup work is mocking the
network packages which never should get called in tests. In this case, the network package, such as Axios,
should get mocked in setup file.

The setup file is in the root of `tests` directory. Note that it should be placed in
[vitest config](https://vitest.dev/config/#setupfiles) in order to be recognized
by vitest. Since setup codes are short, it's better to be in one file, named `setup-tests.ts`.
